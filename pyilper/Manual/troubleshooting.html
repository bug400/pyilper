<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Configuration file problems</h3>

<p>Crashes at start of the program are often caused by a corruped 
configuration file. In this case the configuration file must be
deleted.  The location of the file is platform dependent:</p>

<table class="w3-table-all">
<tr><th>Platform</th><th>Directory</th></tr>
<tr><td>LINUX</td><td>$HOME/.config/pyilper</td></tr>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>%APPDATA%\pyilper</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mac OS X</td><td>$HOME/Library/Application Support/pyilper</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>$HOME</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The name of the configuration file is pyilper<em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is
the version number of the configuration file. The version number of the file is increased every time, if the layout of the configuration file of a new <em>pyILPR</em> version changed. In this case <em>pyILPER</em> must be configured again.</p>

<p>If the program does not start at all you should delete the configuration file and check the file permissions of the configuration directory.</p>

<p>You can invoke <em>pyILPER</em> with the <em>--clean</em> option to initialize the configuration file with default values as well.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Main application error messages</h3>

<p><code>Cannot connect to PIL-Box </code><br>
The application did not succeed to initialize the PIL-Box.
Check if the PIL-Box is connected to the correct port and if the baud rate
is configured according to the PIL-Box jumper setting. Check also, 
if the correct port is specified in the program configuration.</p>

<p><code>Cannot create configuration path</code><br>
The application did not succeed to create the directory
for the configuration file (see above). Check path and
permissions.</p>

<p><code>Cannot read configuration file></code><br>
The application could not read the configuration file. Check
file permissions. If the permissions are correct, purge the file.</p>

<p><code>Cannot write default configuration</code><br>
The application did not succeed to create the configuration file.
Check path and permissions.</p>

<p><code>Cannot write to configuration file></code><br>
The application did not succeed to write to the configuration file.
Check path and permissions.</p>

<p><code>Cannot change to working directory</code><br>
The application did not succeed to change the working
directory to the configured file path. Check path and permissions.

<p><code>Cannot close xxx log file</code><br>
The application did not succeed to close the printer or
scope log file</p>

<p><code>Cannot open xxx log file</code><br>
The application did not succeed to open the printer or
scope logfile. Check path and permissions of the working directory.

<p><code>Cannot write to xxx log file</code><br>
The application did not succeed to write to the printer or
scope logfile. Check file an directory permissions.</p>

<p><code>PIL-Box disconnected after error (Status line message)</code><br>
The application was terminated due to a runtime error. These may
be caused by various reasons. See additional error information.</p>

<p><code>File does not contain a LIF type 1 medium with valid layout
information. Using default layout.</code><br>
The LIF image file does not contain a properly initialized header
with valid layout information. The default layout is used.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> If the default layout does not match the
current medium data corruption may occur!</p>

<p><code>Your configuration files are of pyILPER version: XXX which is newer than the version you are running. The program might crash or mishehave. Do you want to continue?</code><br>
You probably downgraded <em>pyILPER</em> to an older version. The current configuration files might contain data which are not compatible with the running version. To avoid problems, you should reset the configuration files. See the chapter above.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Further hints if the program crashes</h3>

<p>Calling <em>pyILPER</em> from the console gives access to Python runtime errors.</p>
